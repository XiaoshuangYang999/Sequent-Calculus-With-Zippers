# Sequent Calculus with Zippers

This repository contains the Haskell implementation of Xiaoshuang Yang's Master's thesis. The project develops a sequent calculus prover using **zippers** â€” a family of data structures that simplify navigation and structural updates in tree.

We are continuing the development of this prover.
The `thesis-version` branch contains the original code from the thesis,
while ongoing updates and improvements will be done in the `main` branch.

## Bash Instructions

Use `stack build` to build the project.

Use `stack test` to run tests.

Use `stack bench` to run all benchmarks

Use `stack bench :Bench` to run time benchmark.

Use `stack bench :Memory` to run memory benchmark.
